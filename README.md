## Why not [Quick Connect Button](https://modrinth.com/mod/quickconnectbutton)?

- The original author of said mod has left the modding community.
- This mod is available for both Forge and Fabric.

Also, this mod is serving as a testing ground for my eventual move to entirely multiplatform modding.
